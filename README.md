# Node Analysis for Academic Networks
+ Proposed a performance metric *cite ratio* for evaluating influence of authors in academic networks
+ Retrieved comprehensive information of scholars among 5 major fields and 77 academic institutions concerning h-index and paper citations for derivation of *cite ratio*
+ Visualized *cite ratio* distributions and *kernel density estimations* to analyze similarities and differences between more influential fields/institutions and less influential ones. Superiority of academic status is reflected by and strongly related to a higher average/median *cite ratio*
+ Established a standardized publication and citation model for deriving the conclusion that *cite ratio* of an arbitrary author is inversely correlated to his h-index
